# CP1404 Practicals
## Hello, my name is Wang Runze, I am currently doing my bachelor degree on JCU, this repository is about my practical submissions on one of the programming unit I am currently enrolled.
- I learned that variable names must be meaningful and explicit.
- I learned that function docstrings must use imperative mood.
- I learned that main() should only contain bone structures, not details.
